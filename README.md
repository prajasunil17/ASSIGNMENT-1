# ASSIGNMENT 1: Module 2: Basic Python Concepts.

**Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations**

For code review, go inside the code folder and view / download a file named `task1.py`.

1-First, we created two input variables named `param1` and `param2`.

2-After that, we converted them to integers because this task involves a mathematical operation.

3-We assigned each mathematical operation to a separate variable, operation-wise: Addition (add), Subtraction (sub), Multiplication (mul), and Division (div).

4-Finally, we printed the results of all the mathematical operations.

**Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting**

For code review, go inside the code folder and view / download a file named `task2.py`.

1-First, we created two input variables named `firstName` and `lastName`.

2-Finally, we printed the results of both variables concatenated using the `+` symbol, along with a personalized greeting message.
